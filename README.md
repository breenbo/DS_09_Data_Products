# Data Products Projects

There are projects of the Data Science Coursera course, from the John Hopkins Data Science Specialization :

- an [interactive map with gvis](https://breenbo.github.io/DS_09_Data_Products/cityMap.html).
- an [interactive plot with plotly](https://breenbo.github.io/DS_09_Data_Products/plotly.html).
- an [interactive shiny app](https://breenbo.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/) which allow to automate quick view and plots of datasets or .csv files. The [pitch of the app is here](https://breenbo.github.io/DS_09_Data_Products/shinyApp/slides/index.html)
